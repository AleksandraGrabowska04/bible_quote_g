 Introducing My First Major Project in Python Django!
 This project marks a significant milestone in my coding journey. Built using Python Django, the application seamlessly integrates CSS, HTML, 
 and a little bit of JavaScript. The web application is accessible on the internet thanks to PythonAnywhere, 
 a cloud-based platform designed for easy deployment and hosting. To explore the live version of the web app, visit olaolagrabowska.pythonanywhere.com.
